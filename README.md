## Description
The purpose of this project is to allow a user to simply track their workout history. Through intuitive code, both on the front-end and back-end, the app will save user input regarding a workout in process or completed in a database and use that data to produce an easy-to-read chart on the client for the user to reference.

## User Story
```
GIVEN a functional app with proper front-end and back-end code

WHEN I add load the app
THEN I am presented with a simple UI to create a "New Workout"

***Depending on user selection***

1) WHEN I enter the required information regarding the workout and select "Complete"
THEN I am presented with the input I entered on the homepage to describe my "Last Workout" that was completed

2) WHEN I enter the required information regarding the workout and select "Add Exercise"
THEN I am presented with the input I entered on the homepage to describe my "Last Workout" that was completed BUT can select "Continue Workout" to add additional workouts completed on the same day. This will effectively add the data into "Last Workout" on the homepage until I mark my workouts "Compelete" for the day.

WHEN I select Dashboard on the homepage
THEN I am presented with easy-to-read charts to understand my workout history and progress
